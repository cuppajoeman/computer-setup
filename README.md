# computer-setup

This repository lists the tools that I would use to setup a computer, the tool will be for one of the following: (w)indows, (m)ac, (l)inux or (b)rowser

How to install applications. If the application is gui software which autoupdates itself, install it directly from the website. If it is software which is downloadable through a github release or is command line only software consider installing it with scoop.
